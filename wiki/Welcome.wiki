Comments/Suggestion:
  * [http://www.slideshare.net/vimal0212/open-source-library-management-systems/ Open source Library Management Systems] - Very nice presentation. I can say Koha is top on features. PhpMyLibrary is top on usage. You can use Koha right away if you are a perl geek. You can use PhpMyLibrary right away even on hosted Windows/Linux PHP-MySQL environment and knowing only the database settings. The presentation clearly showed what are the things needed for PhpMyLibrary library features. The presentation is a must see for librarians and programmers. If you have a Perl geek in your library, I absolutely suggest using Koha. If you just want to start right away and have your 10,000 collection available online for searching then use PhpMyLibrary.
